Venturing into entrepreneurship, I co-founded Gometa, a web development company. I have learned through experience on how to manage clients requests, overcoming obstacles and handle objections. You can check out our work on the Web Development section.


A turning point in this journey was collaborating with Useappility IKE on a challenging project within WordPress. This experience not only expanded my skills but also emphasized the value of teamwork in real-time situations


Additionally, my foray into e-commerce has been a journey of valuable lessons learned. Focusing more on the design while I was using softwares like Shopify to create my websites.
