<b>Software Development:</b>

I have been into software development lately, and I have created some games from scratch. Both out of curiosity and because I wanted to sharpen my skills
by doing things, hands on experience is the best you can get.

<b>AI Development:</b>

We have been experimenting with [GoMeta](https://gometa.gr){:target="_blank"}, into building AI tools. More updates will come soon. We are at our development stage right now.
