I am a final year student at the University of Macedonia, studying Applied Informatics.
I’m passionate about technology, business, and innovation, constantly building skills that connect tech with real-world impact.


Right now, I’m diving deeper into Artificial Intelligence, trying to understand how AI can change the way we build and use digital tools. I’ve started creating small AI-based projects on my own and sharing them on GitHub — mostly to learn, but also because I really enjoy experimenting.


A few years ago, I co-founded GoMeta, a small web development team where we’ve built websites for several clients. That’s where I really got into WordPress, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and design tools like Elementor, Photoshop, and Canva. I enjoy turning ideas into clean, functional websites that actually work for people.


I also worked with Useappility IKE on a research project called ADAPT, and later helped promote their app AppIT. Those experiences gave me a better understanding of how tech connects with business and users — not just code, but the full process.


Outside of tech, I’ve worked as a manager in a busy café, handling both people and inventory. That taught me a lot about responsibility, communication, and how to stay calm when things get chaotic.


I’m always looking for new challenges — whether it’s building something cool, learning a new skill, or collaborating with people who share the same drive to create and grow.
