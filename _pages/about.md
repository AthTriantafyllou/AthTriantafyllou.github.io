Hey, my name is Athanasios Triantafyllou. I am currently a student at the University of Macedonia in Thessaloniki and a business enthusiast. Developing my skills daily trying to get closer to perfection on various subjects that I am going to talk about in just a second.


The past years I have been into web developing, with my firm called GoMeta. But my passion for technology extends beyond just web development. I have also dabbled in application development for smartphones and search engine optimisation (SEO). Being the co-founder of GoMeta has given me the opportunity to make these areas become like a game to me, and I am constantly seeking new challenges and ways to improve my skills.


But it does not stop there, I have cooperate with Useappility IKE within the framework of the research project ADAPT, Created good connections with the developers of the Useappility team Looking forward for future cooperations.


Currently, I am focused on artificial intelligence (AI) and exploring the vast possibilities that it presents. As an AI enthusiast, I am eager to learn more about how this transformative technology can be applied to various fields and industries.


As a student, I had the time to work as a manager for staff and inventory on a cafe in Thessaloniki, where my responsibilities were over the roof. When you are in charge of expensive inventory and also a team you have to learn how to work under pressure, how to be at the best of your ability every day, how to tackle difficult situations were emotions overcome logic, and still conquer these problems one be one. Being organised combined with the keen eye to details all of these become easy tasks.


In addition to my web development expertise, I have also delved into the world of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Over the year of 2021, I have created NFT projects, bought and sold others, and developed a deep understanding of this exciting new market.


Thank you for taking the time to learn a little more about me. I am excited to continue pushing the boundaries and can't wait to see what the future holds in store!
