I am a final year student at the University of Macedonia, studying Applied Informatics.


Right now, I’m trying to sharpen my skills in <b>Developing</b> using programming languages like Javascript, CSS, HTML, Python and more to create projects of my own. I believe the best way to learn something is by implementing it that exact moment. You can find my work at [Than's Projects](https://thanfyllou.eu/second_brain/index.html){:target="_blank"}.


A few years ago, I co-founded [GoMeta](https://gometa.gr){:target="_blank"}, a tech firm where we’ve built websites for several clients, and now we are diving into <b>creating AI tools</b>. That's where I really got into PostgreSQL, DebianOS, React.js and other tools. My passion for exploring new tech has always been there.


<b>On a second note...</b>


I worked under [Useappility IKE](https://useappility.com){:target="_blank"} as a freelancer on a research project called [ADAPT](https://useappility.com/en/adapt_app/){:target="_blank"}, and later helped promote their app [AppIT](https://appit.info){:target="_blank"}. Those experiences gave me a glimpse inside the corporate world.


Outside of tech, I’ve worked as a manager in a brunch café, handling both our staff and inventory. That taught me a lot about responsibility, communication, and how to stay calm when things get chaotic.


I’m always looking for new challenges — whether it’s building something cool, learning a new skill, or collaborating with people who share the same drive to create and grow.
