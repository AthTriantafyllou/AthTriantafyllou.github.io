I am a final year student at the University of Macedonia, studying Applied Informatics.
I’m passionate about technology, business, and innovation, constantly building skills that connect tech with real-world impact.


Right now, I’m diving deeper into Artificial Intelligence, trying to understand how AI can change the way we build and use digital tools. I’ve started creating small AI-based projects on my own and sharing them on GitHub — mostly to learn, but also because I really enjoy experimenting.


A few years ago, I co-founded [GoMeta](https://gometa.gr){:target="_blank"}, a tech firm where we’ve built websites for several clients, and now we are diving into <b>creating AI tools</b>. That's where I really got into Javascript, Python, CSS, HTML and other design tools. My passion for exploring new tech is just starting out.


<b>On a second note...</b>


I also worked with [Useappility IKE](https://useappility.com){:target="_blank"} on a research project called [ADAPT](https://useappility.com/en/adapt_app/){:target="_blank"}, and later helped promote their app [AppIT](https://appit.info){:target="_blank"}. Those experiences gave me a better understanding of how tech connects with business and users — not just code, but the full process.


Outside of tech, I’ve worked as a manager in a brunch café, handling both people and inventory. That taught me a lot about responsibility, communication, and how to stay calm when things get chaotic.


I’m always looking for new challenges — whether it’s building something cool, learning a new skill, or collaborating with people who share the same drive to create and grow.
